                        <alignment: center> Before joining Coding Temple, I earned my Associate's of Arts degree from Daley College in 2015. After graduation, I worked in customer service until I returned to school to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Health Sciences (Pre-Occupational
                            Therapy). However, I later realized that the health care industry was not for me and left the program. So I decided to re-explore an interest that I had as a teenager, which is coding. I explored by using FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy
                            during my free time and enjoyed it. I am determined to become a Software Engineer and that is why I joined Coding Temple. I am excited to transition into the tech industry through Coding Temple's project-based learning approach.
